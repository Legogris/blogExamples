# Isomorphic React + Flux using Yahoo's Fluxible
This is the source code for my [Isomorphic React + Flux using Yahoo's Fluxible](http://dev.alexishevia.com/2014/11/isomorphic-react-flux-using-yahoos.html) post, where I demonstrate how to create an Isomorphic application using Yahoo's Fluxible library.

To start the server:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
