# Fluxible-App Step by Step
On this post I want to show how to create a fluxible-app step by step. I will be developing one (or several) of Yahoo's [flux examples](https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples).

## Hello World
- Install node.js and npm
- package.json with initial dependencies
- create a basic React component that just renders 'Hello World'
- create an express app (server.js). Add a middleware to render our React component.
